/**
 * Used to mark a specific field as reserved. The value in this field will be read, but will not be
 * copied into the BitsreamElement, and when writing the value will always be all low bits. For a
 * version using high bits, see `@Reserved`
 *
 * Oftentimes it is desirable to avoid naming reserved fields, especially in formats with lots of small reservation
 * sections. Unfortunately Typescript doesn't provide a good way to do this (computed symbol names cannot be generated by
 * function calls).
 *
 * However, be assured that if you reuse a reserved field name in a subclass (which is not itself an error in Typescript),
 * the resulting bitstream representation will still be correct. There are two reasons for this:
 * - Every new field declaration is a new syntax field, even if the field exists in a superclass.
 * - `@ReservedLow()` specifically replaces the name you specify with an anonymous symbol
 *
 * @param length The bitlength determinant
 * @param options Options related to this reserved field
